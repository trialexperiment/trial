# **$TRIAL: A Community-Driven Cryptocurrency**

## **Overview**

$TRIAL is a unique cryptocurrency project that emphasizes community involvement and decentralized decision-making. It started as an unnamed token with no predefined purpose, allowing the community to shape its identity and future.

## **Key Features**

- **Community-Centric:** The project's direction is determined by community polls and discussions.
- **Decentralized:** Power is distributed among the holders, with no single entity controlling the project.
- **Transparent:** All decisions and developments are open and visible to the community.
- **Inclusive:** Everyone is encouraged to participate and contribute to the project's growth.

## **Development**

The project was deployed by an anonymous dev, who handed over all credentials to the elected dev, @axsxy (Moon), who later partnered with @Yieldasaurus as co-developer. Together, they facilitated community engagement to define the token's identity, resulting in the name $TRIAL.

## **Tokenomics**

- **Total Supply:** 100 million tokens
- **Ownership:** No airdrops; the deployer is unrelated to the team.

## **Join the Community**

$TRIAL invites individuals to be part of this decentralized journey, offering a platform for collaboration and innovation in the cryptocurrency space.
